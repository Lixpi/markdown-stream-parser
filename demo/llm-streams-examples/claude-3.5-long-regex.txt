Let me create a complex regex pattern that's approximately 200 characters long. This pattern will be quite extensive and might be used for various matching scenarios.

Here's the regex pattern:


```regex
^(?:[A-Za-z0-9!@#$%^&*()_+\-=\[\]{};:'",.<>?\/\\|`~]+)(?:\s*[A-Za-z0-9!@#$%^&*()_+\-=\[\]{};:'",.<>?\/\\|`~]+){3,}(?:\d{2,4})(?:[A-Za-z0-9!@#$%^&*()_+\-=\[\]{};:'",.<>?\/\\|`~]+)(?:\s*[A-Za-z0-9!@#$%^&*()_+\-=\[\]{};:'",.<>?\/\\|`~]+){2,}$
```


This regex pattern is designed to:
- Start with any alphanumeric or special characters
- Follow with 3 or more groups of the same character types with optional whitespace
- Include 2-4 digits
- End with 2 or more groups of alphanumeric or special characters with optional whitespace

This pattern is quite complex and might need to be adjusted based on specific use cases. Would you like me to explain any particular part of this pattern in detail?
