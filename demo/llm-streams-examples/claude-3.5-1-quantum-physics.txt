##### Introduction to Quantum Physics
Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the molecular, atomic, nuclear, and even smaller microscopic levels.

###### Core Concepts

* **Wave-Particle Duality**
  * Light and matter can exhibit characteristics of both waves and particles
  * Demonstrated by the famous double-slit experiment

* **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**
  * Cannot simultaneously know both position and momentum with absolute precision
  * Mathematically expressed as:

```latex
ΔxΔp ≥ ħ/2
```

* **Quantum Superposition**
  * Particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously
  * Only when measured does the wavefunction "collapse" into a definite state

###### Quantum Entanglement
When two or more particles become entangled, their quantum states become interconnected, regardless of the distance between them. Einstein famously called this "*spooky action at a distance*".

##### Mathematical Framework
The cornerstone equation of quantum mechanics is the Schrödinger equation:


```latex
iħ∂Ψ/∂t = ĤΨ
```
