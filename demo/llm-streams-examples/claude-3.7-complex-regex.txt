# Most Complicated Regex Ever Imagined

Ah, a challenge to create the most complex regex imaginable! Regular expressions can indeed become incredibly intricate, especially when attempting to validate or extract patterns with multiple conditions and edge cases.

Here's one of the most complicated regex patterns I can imagine - it attempts to validate a complex password with numerous requirements:

```regex
^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]{8,}(?=.*[a-z]{2,})(?=.*[A-Z]{2,})(?!.*(.)\1{2,})(?!.*(123|abc|qwe|password|admin))(?=.*[!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>])(?=.*\d.*\d.*\d)(?!.*\s)(?=.*[a-z].*[A-Z].*\d.*[@$!%*?&])(?!.*([A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&])\1{3,})(?=.{16,32})(?=(?:.*[!@#$%^&*()\-_=+{};:,<.>]){2,})(?!.*(?:Jan|Feb|Mar|Apr|May|Jun|Jul|Aug|Sep|Oct|Nov|Dec))(?!.*(?:0[1-9]|[12]\d|3[01])(?:0[1-9]|1[0-2])(?:\d{2}|\d{4}))
```

## What This Monster Does

This regex enforces a password that:

1. Contains at least one lowercase letter
2. Contains at least one uppercase letter
3. Contains at least one digit
4. Contains at least one special character
5. Is at least 8 characters long
6. Has at least 2 lowercase letters
7. Has at least 2 uppercase letters
8. Doesn't contain any character repeated more than twice in a row
9. Doesn't contain common patterns like "123", "abc", "qwe", "password", or "admin"
10. Contains at least one special character from an expanded set
11. Contains at least 3 digits
12. Contains no whitespace
13. Has lowercase, uppercase, digit, and special character in some order
14. Doesn't contain any character repeated 4+ times
15. Is between 16 and 32 characters
16. Contains at least 2 special characters
17. Doesn't contain month names
18. Doesn't contain dates in various formats

## Breaking It Down

The regex uses multiple positive and negative lookaheads to enforce these conditions without actually consuming characters, making it extraordinarily complex and computationally expensive.

In a real-world scenario, such a complex regex would likely be broken down into multiple checks or implemented with dedicated validation functions instead of a single pattern.

Would you like me to explain any particular part of this regex in more detail?
